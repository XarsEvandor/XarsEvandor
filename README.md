- 👋 Hi, I’m @XarsEvandor. I am a second year honorary cs student in Anatolia College of Thessaloniki.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and applying myself on as much knowledge around Cs as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, c++, java, arduino C, oracle sql and Pl/sql.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might prove useful towards expanding my knowledge on Cs.
- 📫 Feel free to drop me an e-mail at: giorgos_katsonis@hotmail.com
